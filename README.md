Jekyll theme for my blog forked from [sakura-jekyll](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura-jekyll). It's based on the minimal css framework: [sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura)

- Uses CSSs on CDN.
- <s>`earthly` scheme is the default (due to my preference and readability).</s>
- Use custom <s>color scheme</s> `a` element to improve readability.
- Dark mode available.
- Datetime is shown in ISO8601 format.
- Tags and Categories are available through [jekyll-archives](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives) plugin.
- Uses the latest `normalize.css` from official CDN.
- Remove `margin-bottom` from nested list.

Sites based on this theme can be built automatically with github actions. Refer to [this link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/#setting-up-the-action).
